"As I put the twins in cryo, I could not contain my tears. I knew this was goodbye, but even in that moment they were still trying to cheer me up. They trusted me, and I was betraying their trust. I was sending them, all alone and helpless, to an unfamiliar and inhospitable place.

They will adapt and survive, without a shadow of a doubt, but will they be able to understand and forgive me?

"We spent the previous night around a small campfire. They never liked fires, but seemed to feel safer while I was around. It was a good evening filled with many positive emotions, but my knowing that it was to be our last made my every smile feel insincere.

All the way to the Human homeworld."
