"It pleased and terrified me to see just how few shits were given about that warning by my science team. I fully share their dismay at the notion of using MCCs on our harmless creatures; I'm proud to know that they're not heartless, but I cannot help feeling grave concern for their safety, were they to openly voice what they feel.

Heartbreaking as our work can be, we have to remember that we are not irreplaceable. If we won't do it, they'll find somebody else who will... and that somebody may not share our empathy."
