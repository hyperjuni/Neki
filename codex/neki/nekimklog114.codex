"We've been closely studying the family of Earth-bound predator species, identified as the most likely source of the foreign genetic material.

The proportions of its' members vary greatly; from shoe-sized ones to ones as large as a mooshi. Their innate perceptiveness, agility and relative strength appear to be superior to those of most other Earth creatures of similar size; traits which would be highly advantageous to strategic operational assets, if enhanced by the relevant genetic code.  ^cyan;>>^reset;",

"The possibility of the original research being militant or tactical in nature can be all but ruled out at this point, as there is no evidence to suggest that any attempts at introducing much, if any, physiologically superior genetic code were ever made.

It would appear that the alterations made by the Humans were purely cosmetic in nature, with no apparent goal of genetically enhancing their own species in any meaningful way."
